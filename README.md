# Curiosity Stack

**A structured research thinking tool for enterprise professionals and investors.**

> *"The intent is not to reach the end of the process but to go through the process itself."*

## What This Is

A plugin that decodes any technology or market signal into 2nd and 3rd order business insights — using layer-by-layer question sequencing that takes you from noise to structured understanding.

Not a stock tips tool. Not a recommendation engine. A rigorous thinking partner for people who want to understand deeply before they decide anything.

---

## The Six Layers

| Layer | Question | What You Find |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| L0 | What's the signal? | Why this matters now |
| L1 | What is it really? | Actual mechanics, not headlines |
| L2 | What causes it? | The root cause tree |
| L3 | What fixes it? | Solution categories = industries |
| L4 | What does it require? | Inputs, infrastructure, talent |
| L5 | Who does this work? | Named companies — global + India |
| L6 | Research landscape | How the space is typically accessed |

---

## How It Works — Point A to Point B

**Install** → Open Cowork → Welcome message fires automatically → Run `/curiosity-stack:setup` (2 minutes, once) → Describe any topic in plain language → Walk 6 layers → Choose output → Done.

From the second session onwards: just describe a topic. The plugin reads your saved context silently and begins.

---

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/curiosity-stack:setup` | First-time setup — connect sources, set context, configure monitoring |
| `/curiosity-stack:decompose` | Guided layer-by-layer decomposition |
| `/curiosity-stack:india-proxy` | Autonomous agent — finds Indian equivalents of any global company or theme |
| `/curiosity-stack:stress-test` | Thesis stress test — proponents, critics, core assumptions, failure modes |
| `/curiosity-stack:library` | Browse, search, and manage your decomposition library |
| `/curiosity-stack:watchlist` | Manage watchlist topics, triggers, cadence, and digest settings |
| `/curiosity-stack:running-horse` | Volume Profile + momentum agent (quick/deep) — identifies "running horses" via HVN/LVN, volume behavior, QCE-IM & Darvas structure | 

---

## After Every Decomposition

You choose your output format — then get:

- **Value Chain diagram** — layered visual map with India 🇮🇳 badges
- **Interactive Mindmap** — radial diagram with expandable nodes and hover cards
- **Research Note** — downloadable `.md` document, professional research brief format
- **Thesis Stress Test** — proponents, critics, core assumption, how wrong this could be
- **5 curated reading recommendations** targeted at the specific topic and layers explored
- Option to save to your connected Drive, Notion, or Airtable

---

## Decomposition Library

Every completed session can be saved locally to the `library/` folder. Optionally mirrored to Google Drive or Notion for backup and cross-device access.

**What's saved:** topic, date, all 6 layer summaries, sources cited, tags (sector, geography, stage), conviction placeholder.

**Retrieval:** when you start a new decomposition, the plugin checks your library for past sessions on the same topic and asks if you want to load it — saving you ground you've already covered.

**Layer delta:** revisit a topic months later and the plugin compares the new decomposition against your saved one — showing exactly what changed at each layer.

---

## Watchlist Tracker + Trigger Alerts

Monitor any topic within its value chain — automatically, on your schedule.

**Tracker mode** — runs on your set cadence (daily / weekly / fortnightly). Covers everything on your watchlist. Maps findings to the value chain layer they affect. Scores materiality HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW with reasoning. Delivers a structured digest to your Gmail automatically, with a Cowork link to go deeper.

**Trigger mode** — set a specific condition per topic per layer:
*"Alert me when something changes at Layer 4 of EV batteries"*
The agent checks that condition each run and fires only when met — flagged as 🚨 in your digest.

Signal types monitored: news, regulatory changes, new entrants, funding rounds.

Configure via `/curiosity-stack:watchlist` or during setup.

---

## Source Credibility

A personal source registry that builds over time.

After each session, rate the sources used (30–60 seconds, max 3 per session). Over time the plugin learns which publications, databases, and analysts work best for you by sector and layer.

At Layer 1 and Layer 5 of every decomposition, your top-rated sources are surfaced automatically — so you spend less time searching and more time reading the right things.

After 5+ decompositions, the plugin suggests ratings based on your usage patterns. You confirm or override.

---

## The India Proxy Agent

`/curiosity-stack:india-proxy` is a fully autonomous research agent, not a prompt.

You give it a global company or theme. It independently:
1. Researches the actual business model of the global reference point
2. Searches Tracxn, Inc42, Screener.in, NASSCOM, and general web sources
3. Validates each candidate against red flag criteria (AI-washing, segment size, client verifiability)
4. Returns a structured shortlist with proxy pattern, access method, validation signals, and watch triggers

If it finds nothing meaningful, it says so — that is itself a useful research finding.

---

## Connect Your Sources

Works standalone. Significantly better with your notes connected.

Works with all connectors you have enabled in Cowork — Gmail, Google Drive, Slack, Notion, GitHub, and more. Connect your tools in Cowork Settings → Connectors.

Connect through `/curiosity-stack:setup` — no file editing required.

---

## Making It Yours

### Option 1 — Edit `curiosity-stack.local.md` (recommended)

Fill in your context once and the plugin personalises every session without needing setup commands.

```yaml
# Core context
context:        # Investor / Enterprise professional / Both
geography:      # India / Global / Both
themes:         # Topics you are actively researching
watchlist:      # Companies or topics to track
deprioritise:   # Sectors you already know well
default_output: # value-chain / mindmap / research-note
notes:          # Depth vs breadth preference, etc.

# Library
library_save:   # always / ask / never
library_mirror: # drive / notion / local

# Watchlist monitoring
watchlist_cadence:       # daily / weekly / fortnightly
watchlist_email:         # your email address
watchlist_email_enabled: # true / false

# Source credibility
source_rating_enabled:   # true / false
```

### Option 2 — Edit the skills

The skills in `/skills/` are plain Markdown files. Customise:
- **`curiosity-framework/SKILL.md`** — adjust layer definitions, add example decompositions
- **`company-discovery/SKILL.md`** — add India proxy patterns specific to your focus areas
- **`sebi-compliance/SKILL.md`** — adjust disclaimer language for your jurisdiction
- **`source-credibility/SKILL.md`** — add sources you already know are reliable

### Option 3 — Add your own skills

Drop a new folder into `/skills/` with a `SKILL.md` file. Useful for:
- A sector-specific decomposition template
- A custom output format for your note-taking system
- A personal red flag list for company validation
